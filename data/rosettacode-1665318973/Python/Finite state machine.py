''' Finite State Machine for Rosetta Code
Actually two of them.  The main FSM described in the task and a second one of the Acceptor variety described on 
the WP page to get the input from the user.

I handled the implicit transition by defining a null list as the valid inputs. and made my Acceptor return the 
null string ('') for the instance of no valid inputs.  Then just defined the the transition for current state and null 
string for input. 

I find it interesting that the rules for such a simple fsm took more lines of code than the actual code for the fsm which 
can be fed many different sets of rules.  Storing the rules in a databse would reduce the lines required for storing 
the rules'''
